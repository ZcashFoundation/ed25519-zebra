# ed25519_zebra JNI code
Code that allows for any JNI-using language to interact with specific `ed25519-zebra` calls.

## Compilation
`cargo build`

## Testing
`sbt test`

## Usage
The code must be able to access the `libed25519jni` dynamic library / shared object generated by Rust. Once compiled and loaded, code can use the accompanying Java file to access specific `ed25519-zebra`. The calls include but are not necessarily limited to:

* Generating a random 32 byte signing key seed.
* Generating a 32 byte verification key from a signing key seed.
* Signing arbitrary data with a signing key.
* Verifying a signature for arbitrary data with a verification key.
